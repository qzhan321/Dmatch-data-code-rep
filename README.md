# Dmatch-data-code-rep

This repository contains the code for generating simulation data sets with batch effects, running different methods on the simulation datasets, and evaluating the performance of bach effects correction of different methods for the article https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.05.895136v1.

The code mostly borrows from https://github.com/JinmiaoChenLab/Batch-effect-removal-benchmarking, which is a repository documenting datasets and scripts used in article entitled "A benchmark of batch-effect correction methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data" (https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1850-9).
